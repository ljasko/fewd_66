Here is a link to my project proposal. 

As you'll see, I approached it like a light product spec, so you will see that much of it will be added to and iterated as time goes on, including the wireframes. The content grayed out explicitly has not been completed for this checkpoint.

You have direct commenting access!

Please note what's highlighted in yellow: I am requesting some accelerated deadlines and feedback for some of the later milestones because I will be on vacation during our final few days to make final revisions.
